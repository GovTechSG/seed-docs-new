  <summary style="font-size:18px">macOS</summary>

  1. Open **Terminal** and run `mdatp health`.
  2. Take note of the value displayed for **org_id**.

  > **Note**:
  > If this command does not return anything, it indicates your device does not have Defender. Hence, [proceed to onboard your macOS device to SEED](onboard-device/mac-os).

  3. Identify the organisation corresponding to this **org_id** from the following table. This is the organisation of the Defender or the antivirus on your device.

    | org_id  | Organisation |
    | ------------- |:-------------:|
    | faa36a5e-2da6-4225-8e27-226177c801a0      | WOG     |
    | 49237d71-42ac-425a-a803-881b92cc18ce  | TechPass    |
    | 6389e966-e334-461d-86ce-0fed12484620      | Hive    |

  4. Choose the required step from the following:

    - If your organisation id corresponds to WOG or TechPass, it indicates that **Microsoft Defender** has been configured correctly and you can ignore the rest of this section.

    - If your organisation id corresponds to Hive, it indicates that your device is still enrolled with Hive. Contact [Hive support](mailto:GDS_DEN@hive.gov.sg) to get the offboarding package to unenrol your device. See the [offboarding FAQ](offboard-device/seed-offboarding-faq.md) to know how to unenrol your device from Defender using the Hive offboarding package.
    
    - If your device is enrolled with a different MDM, contact your organisation IT support to unenrol your device from it.

Within the next few hours, **Intune** pushes the **Microsoft Defender** client to your device with the correct configurations. For more information on the duration, refer to [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/device-profile-troubleshoot#how-long-does-it-take-for-devices-to-get-a-policy-profile-or-app-after-they-are-assigned).

At any time, users can Sign in to Company Portal app, click the three dots and choose **Check status** to check for policy or profile updates. It may take a while to complete the synchronisation. When completed, the screen will show the timestamp of the last successful sync.

3. On **Powershell**, run the following command:

```
$reg64 = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]::OpenBaseKey([Microsoft.Win32.RegistryHive]::LocalMachine, [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryView]::Registry64)
$OrgID =  $reg64.OpenSubKey("SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Windows Advanced Threat Protection\Status").GetValue("OrgID")
echo $OrgID
```
4. Take note of the value displayed for **OrgID**.

?> Note: If you don't get any response, it means you do not have Defender installed on your device. You can skip the steps in this section. Hence, [proceed to onboard your Windows device to SEED](onboard-device/windows).

5. Identify the organisation corresponding to this **OrgId** from the following table. This is the organisation of the Defender or the antivirus on your device.

  | OrgId  | Organisation |
  | ------------- |:-------------:|
  | faa36a5e-2da6-4225-8e27-226177c801a0      | WOG     |
  | 49237d71-42ac-425a-a803-881b92cc18ce  | TechPass    |
  | 6389e966-e334-461d-86ce-0fed12484620      | Hive     |

6. Choose the required step from the following:

  - If your organisation id corresponds to WOG or TechPass, it indicates that **Microsoft Defender** has been configured correctly and you can ignore the rest of this section.

  - If your organisation id corresponds to Hive, it indicates that your device is still enrolled with Hive. Contact [Hive support](mailto:GDS_DEN@hive.gov.sg) to get the offboarding package to unenrol your device.

At any time, users can manually sync by going to **Start** > **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Access work or school** > **Work or School Account** > **Info** > **Sync**. Alternatively, Open the Company Portal app on your device, go to **Settings** > **Sync**. Wait while Company Portal syncs your device. When complete, the screen will show the timestamp of the last successful sync.

 4. Based on the **org_id**, identify the organisation of the Defender or the antivirus on your device.
 
 > **Note**:
  >- The org_id displayed depends on the TechPass account used for enrolling your device to SEED.
  >- If your TechPass ID used for SEED onboarding is similar to <em>your_name<span>@</span>tech.gov.sg</em> or <em>your_name<span>@</span><agency>.gov.sg</em>, your device will be onboarded to SEED under WOG profile - SG Govt M365 profile.</li>
  >- If your TechPass ID used for SEED onboarding is similar to <em>your_name<span>@</span>techpass.gov.sg</em>, your device will be onboarded to SEED under TECHPASS profile.

  > **Note**: If you have any issues in accessing the link to download the offboarding script,
  >- Access the link in incognito mode.
  >- Make sure you are using only the [supported browsers](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/additional-resources/best-practices?id=supported-browsers).
  >- If you still have issues in downloading the script, create a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support).

  5. Once you get the offboarding script, run it on your device to unenrol Defender from your device completely.

   > **Note**:
   > For more information on how to run the offboarding script to remove Defender from the macOS device, refer to **[Remove existing software on your device](prerequisites-for-onboarding?id=remove-existing-software-on-your-device)**.

  The OrgId displayed depends on the TechPass account you used for enrolling your device to SEED.
