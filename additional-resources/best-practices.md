# Best practices
This section provides a concise summary and quick reference to the general recommendations, best practices, and tips outlined throughout this document. These guidelines are essential for addressing common issues effectively.

## Apple ID and recovery keys
Before onboarding your macOS device, ensure that you have associated your Apple ID and have your recovery keys readily available. Depending on your device settings, during onboarding, you may encounter several restarts and may need to reset your device password.

For a seamless onboarding experience, it is crucial to link your Apple ID to your device. Please have your recovery keys at hand in case you encounter any difficulties with password reset or device login.
