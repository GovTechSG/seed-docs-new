# Offboard device from SEED

We have now automated most of the offboarding steps to simplify the process. This new offboarding method consists of the following two phases:

- **Phase A: Offboard device from SEED components**
- **Phase B: Submit Intune Device ID to remove device record**

!>**Important note**<br> Make sure you complete **Phase B** immediately after **Phase A**. If not, your device update policy may reinstall the latest version of the deleted SEED components. 

To know the steps in each phase see:
