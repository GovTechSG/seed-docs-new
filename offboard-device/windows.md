  !> **Important**<br>- If your **Defender organisation** is **Hive**, please skip the remaining steps in this document. You need to get the offboarding package from the Hive support and unenrol your device from Defender. See the [offboarding FAQs](offboard-device/seed-offboarding-faqs.md) to know how to unenrol your device from Defender using the Hive offboarding package.<br><br>- If your **Defender organisation** is either **WOG** or **TechPass**, you need to use your TechPass to download the offboarding package and proceed with the remaining steps.<br><br>- If your **Defender organisation** is **none of the above**, contact the IT support of the organisation that provided you with the device.

6. Go to the folder where you downloaded the ZIP file and extract the files. You should see the following two files.

8. On **Powershell**, run the following command to go to the folder which has the extracted files:

    ```
    cd {Path from clipboard}
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    cd "C:\Users\testUser\Downloads\Offboarding_local_tp_windows"
