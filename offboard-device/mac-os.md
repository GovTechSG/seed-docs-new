1. Open the **Terminal** and execute the following commands:

```
intune_id="$(security find-certificate -a /Library/Keychains/System.keychain | egrep -B 4 '\"issu\"<blob>=.+MICROSOFT INTUNE MDM DEVICE CA' | grep alis | cut -d '"' -f 4)"
if [ -z "$intune_id" ]
then
    echo "Intune ID not found"
    return
fi

num_candidates="$(echo "$intune_id" | wc -l | xargs echo -n)"
if [ "$num_candidates" -eq 1 ]
then
    echo "$intune_id"
    return
fi

old_ifs="$IFS"
IFS='\n'
actual_id="Intune ID not found"
curr_latest_end_date_unix=0
while read id
do
    end_date="$(security find-certificate -c "$id" -p /Library/Keychains/System.keychain | openssl x509 -noout -enddate | cut -d '=' -f 2)"
    end_date_unix="$(date -j -f "%b %e %H:%M:%S %Y %Z" "$end_date" "+%s")"
    if [ "$end_date_unix" -ge "$curr_latest_end_date_unix" ]
    then
        actual_id="$id"
        curr_latest_end_date_unix="$end_date_unix"
    fi
done <<< "$intune_id"

IFS="$old_ifs"
echo "$actual_id"
```
2. Note down the Intune Device ID that is displayed on the **Terminal** window.

## Phase A: Offboard device from SEED components

1. Go to **Terminal** and run `mdatp health`.

![find-org-id](../images/macos-find-org-id-1.png)-->

2. Take note of the value displayed for **org_id**.

![note-org-id](../images/macos-find-org-id-2.png)

3. Refer to the following table and identify your **Defender organisation** and download the respective offboarding package.

  | org_id  | Defender organisation | Offboarding package |
  | ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
  | faa36a5e-2da6-4225-8e27-226177c801a0      | WOG     | [Download offboarding package](https://k3uwa66lu3tj6uxft46666ynhe0uvzor.lambda-url.ap-southeast-1.on.aws/local_wog_mac)    |
  | 49237d71-42ac-425a-a803-881b92cc18ce  | TechPass    | [Download offboarding package](https://k3uwa66lu3tj6uxft46666ynhe0uvzor.lambda-url.ap-southeast-1.on.aws/local_tp_mac)     |
  | 6389e966-e334-461d-86ce-0fed12484620 | Hive | Contact [Hive support](mailto:GDS_DEN@hive.gov.sg) to get the offboarding package. |


!> **Important**
>
> - If your **Defender organisation** is **Hive**, please disregard the remaining steps in this document. Instead, you should obtain the offboarding package from Hive support and unenroll your device from Defender. Refer to the [offboarding FAQs](offboard-device/seed-offboarding-faqs.md) for guidance on unenrolling your device from Defender using the Hive offboarding package.
>   
> - If your **Defender organisation** is either **WOG** or **TechPass**, you should use your TechPass account to download the offboarding package and proceed with the remaining steps.
>   
> - If your **Defender organisation** is **none of the above**, please reach out to the IT support of the organization that provided you with the device for further assistance.


4. Go to the folder where you downloaded the ZIP file and extract the files. You should see the following two files.

![extract-files](../images/macos-extracted-files-for-offboarding.png)

?> **Note**: The file names vary with the organisation.

5. On your **Terminal**, go to the folder where you extracted the files. For example, if they are in the **Downloads** > **Offboarding_local_wog_mac** folder, go to that folder.

![cd-extracted-folder](../images/macos-cd-downloads.png)

6. Copy the below and run it on the same **Terminal**.

    ```
    sudo chmod +x local_mac_offboarding.sh
    ```

7. When prompted for a **Password**, enter your device password.
8. Copy and run the following command on your **Terminal**.

    ```
    sudo ./local_mac_offboarding.sh
    ```

When you see the following success message on your **Terminal**, you will be automatically directed to the **SEED Offboarding: Device Record Removal** form to submit the Intune Device ID.

![macos-success-message](../images/macos-success-message.png)

!>**Important note**<br> Make sure you complete the steps in Phase B immediately after Phase A. Failure to do so may result in your device update policy reinstalling the latest version of the removed SEED components.
