> **Note**
>- SEED does not support running other VPN clients together with Cloudflare WARP. 
>- We recommend not to turn on WARP and the VPN at the same time.

2.  Verify if you are running any VPN client concurrently with warp on and complete the following steps as needed:

    a. If yes, make sure the VPN configuration does not route all traffic and DNS queries to the VPN server.

    b. If no, proceed to step 3.

3.
