# Troubleshooting

## Experiencing the *Account does not have access* error

When using SGTS products with Cloudflare WARP, you might encounter an error message saying, "That account does not have access".

## Solution

1.  First, check the following:

    - Have you received the "successfully onboarded" email from DEEP?
    - Are you using one of the [supported browsers](additional-resources/best-practices)?
    - Is your Cloudflare WARP client connected and up to date?
    - Open Cloudflare WARP **Settings** and ensure "Gateway with WARP" is selected.
    - For Windows users, check if Tanium is listed in the **Start** menu.
    - For macOS users, look for Tanium in **Finder** > **Applications**.
    - Ensure your device's operating system is up to date.
    - Make sure Defender is updated and running.
    - Check if your TechPass account has the necessary permissions for GCC 2.0 CMP or a specific SGTS service.

> **Note**
>- SEED does not support running other VPN clients alongside Cloudflare WARP.
>- It is recommended not to use WARP and a VPN simultaneously.

2. If you are running a VPN client along with WARP, ensure that the VPN configuration doesn't route all traffic and DNS queries to the VPN server.

3. If the issues persist, [generate a diagnostic report](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/#/faqs/how-to-generate-and-upload-diagnostic-files-to-incident-support-request) and upload it to the [incident support request](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/security-suite-for-engineering-endpoint-devices/raise-an-incident-support-request).
