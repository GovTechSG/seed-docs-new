  <summary>Why is Microsoft Defender not automatically installed after enrolling in Company Portal?</summary>

  This can happen if Defender or any other antivirus solution previously installed on the device was not completely removed before onboarding to SEED.

  <summary>While onboarding to Microsoft Intune, I receive an error message: "Could not download the identity profile from the Encrypted Profile Service. The credentials within the Device Enrolment profile may have expired." What should I do?</summary>

  One possible reason for this error is that your device may have been previously onboarded to Microsoft Intune by a different user and was not properly offboarded during the pre-onboarding steps.

  To confirm this, please [raise a support request][raise-support-request] and provide your device's serial number. The SEED team will investigate whether your device was previously enrolled in Microsoft Intune under a different user.

  If this is confirmed, you can choose one of the following options to offboard your device from Microsoft Intune and then retry the SEED onboarding process:

  - For Windows users, refer to the [SEED offboarding steps for Windows](offboard-device/windows).
  - For macOS users, go to **System Preferences** and locate the old Management Profile. Follow the [SEED offboarding steps for macOS](offboard-device/mac-os).

<details>
  <summary>What should I do if my device is not automatically renamed after SEED onboarding?</summary>

  This can happen if Defender or any other antivirus already installed on the device was not completely removed before onboarding to SEED. To confirm this, [Verify if Microsoft Defender is configured correctly on your device][verify-defender-configuration].
