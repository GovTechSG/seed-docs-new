<summary>What should I do if I encounter an error on my macOS device while running the offboarding package to remove SEED components like Cloudflare WARP, Microsoft Defender, or Tanium Client?</summary>

Try running the script again. If you still experience any error, raise a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) with the TechPass and SEED support.

<summary>After successfully completing Phase A to offboard my device from SEED components, I receive the error <b>Intune ID not found. Please manually input your Intune ID</b>. What should I do?</summary>

You may encounter this error if we are unable to auto-retrieve your Intune Device ID due to incorrect configurations on your device.

1. To get your Intune Device ID, either:
    - Go to the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/secure/account/profile) and retrieve the Intune Device ID from your account profile.
    - If you can't access the TechPass portal, raise a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) with the TechPass and SEED support to obtain your Intune Device ID.

2. Once you have your Intune Device ID, proceed with **Phase B: Submit Intune Device ID** to remove the device record.

If there is a significant time lapse between Phase B and Phase A, the latest version of the SEED components may be reinstalled on your device. In that case, you need to repeat **Phase A: Offboard device from SEED components**.

<details>
<summary>After submitting the Intune Device ID, I received an email stating that my offboarding was unsuccessful. What should I do?</summary>

This can happen if you submitted an incorrect Intune Device ID.

1. To get your correct Intune Device ID, either:
    - Retrieve the Intune Device ID from your account profile on the [TechPass portal](https://portal.techpass.gov.sg/secure/account/profile).
    - If you can't access the TechPass portal, raise a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support) with the TechPass and SEED support to obtain the correct Intune Device ID.

2. Complete the [offboarding steps](offboard-device/offboard-device-from-seed) for your device.

If your offboarding is still unsuccessful despite submitting the correct Intune Device ID, please raise a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support).

</details>

<details>
<summary>After submitting my Intune Device ID, I did not receive the successfully offboarded email. What should I do?</summary>

It may take up to 30 minutes for the SEED team to send the successfully offboarded email to you. If you still have not received this email, please raise a [support request](https://go.gov.sg/seed-techpass-support).

If the TechPass and SEED support team completes the offboarding for you, you may not receive this email from the SEED team. However, the TechPass and SEED support team can confirm if you have successfully offboarded your device from SEED.
